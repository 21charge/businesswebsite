        <h1>The Creative Struggle in Pursuit of Success</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p class="lead">The creative will and have always lost—or at least that’s what the debilitating sense of self-imposed by society has led us to believe. This veil, thin yet suffocating, convinces us that the extraordinary is impossible. But is it really? How do we explain the impossible becoming possible, over and over again?</p>

            <h2>The Impossible Made Possible</h2>
            <p>The four-minute mile—shattered when people thought it couldn’t be done. A 500kg deadlift—"pfft," they said, until someone pulled it. Going from SNL to president—dream on, right? These milestones were once dismissed as fantasies. We’ve all encountered this skepticism, whether as spectators or participants (depending on our age and perspective). Yet here you are, reading this, hoping that what we’ve been taught isn’t all there is. Let’s break it down:</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>What is this thing people call "happiness" or "success"?</h2>
            <p>Why is it such a taboo for creatives? What is there to look forward to? And finally, what should you do? So grab a coffee, cigarette, glass of water, or a breath of fresh air—whatever fuels your soul—and follow along.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>The Meaning of Success</h2>
            <p>There are many interpretations of this thing—some people call it happiness, success, purpose, and in some cases, faith (not religion). But what is it actually? Well, the dictionary says success can be defined as the accomplishment of a name, attainment of profit or popularity, whereas happiness is defined as a feeling of contentment, delight, or being pleased.</p>
            <p>Now, if that's what you came here for, then thank you for the time. Enjoy your day with that new insight, but I feel like there is more to it than that.</p>

            <h2>The Loss of “Why”</h2>
            <p>Growing up, when we got asked what we wanted to be, we were in one of two boats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Boat one:</strong> "I want to be a teacher, doctor, or president because these are people who can make changes in the lives of others."</li>
                <li><strong>Boat two:</strong> Nudge nudge, this was me, "I want to be a ninja, astronaut, or in my case, I wanted to fly dragons and have one leg because that’s what the plot to *How to Train Your Dragon* was."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You might be wondering why I’m saying all this. It’s because, as we grow older, we don’t just lose the belief that dragons exist in Norway—we lose something far more important: the answer to our why.</p>
            <p>Ask a child why they want to be a president or a doctor, and they’ll probably say something like, “To make people better, make sweets free forever, and ensure unlimited nap times for everyone.” Honestly, I’d vote for a president with that campaign slogan. But I digress.</p>
            <p>The point is, these answers are rooted in the pursuit of something greater than ourselves. Call it public service in the form of endless naps or a groundbreaking medical career that cures all diseases. Somewhere along the way, we’re conditioned to think these dreams are childish or unrealistic. That unwavering “what if” gets replaced by “be realistic.”</p>

            <h2>Why Creativity Fails</h2>
            <p>But is the pursuit of creativity and purpose all sunshine and rainbows? No, and here’s why creatives often fail: it’s in what happens after the dream—the next steps.</p>
            <p>Let me borrow a concept from a pretty cool guy, Alex Hormozi (you should definitely check him out). He borrowed this from someone else, but it’s gold:</p>
            <p>Imagine a graph. It starts at a point called Discovery. We’ve all been there. It’s when you learn something new—whether through creativity, curiosity, or inspiration from someone else.</p>
            <p>For example, let’s talk about happiness. I had a friend—let’s call him Mickey Mouse—who seemed genuinely happy. His joy came from being unapologetically himself: worry-free, jovial, and carefree. He didn’t second-guess himself, even when others cringed out of insecurity.</p>
            <p>When I first met Mickey, I thought, “Wow, he’s really happy. I’m going to try that too!” At first, I felt great—an uninformed optimism where everything seemed perfect. But then life hit me. People who I thought liked me for who I was started giving me weird looks. My family had expectations I wasn’t meeting. Optimism turned into informed pessimism.</p>
            <p>This is where most people give up. We throw our hands in the air and say, “Forget this—Mickey Mouse is crazy. I’m asking Donald Duck instead.”</p>
            <p>(Yes, the Disney characters might seem unnecessary, but the lesson is there.)</p>
            <p>Creativity fails because we don’t see the work behind the why. Running a four-minute mile requires hours of grueling training. Lifting 500kg in the gym isn’t about the moment on stage—it’s the years of reps that came before it. Even starting a campaign to be president as a "playboy billionaire" and former SNL actor seemed like a joke—until it wasn’t.</p>

            “The only true failure is giving up.” – Chris Williamson
        </blockquote>

        <article>
            <h2>What You Need to Do</h2>
            <p>So, when the ball is in your court, the question isn’t just, “What do I want out of this endeavor?” It’s: Will I leap, stride, fall, and fail to get there? Will I push past informed pessimism to rediscover my why? Or better yet: Will you?</p>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <p>If you’ve decided yes, then let’s skip to the good part—what is there to do now? Now that we know there’s a dream to chase, or at least a reason to chase it, we have some things to do. (This is the difficult part.) It’s the work. The late nights, early mornings, and working when everyone else would stop.</p>
            <p>I’ll steal a beautiful quote to preface everything we are about to go through:</p>
            <blockquote>
                “This is when everyone else would stop and this is why they aren’t successful.” – Chris Williamson
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is the best way to summarize this concept: the days of hard and arduous work will come, and what will your decision be? Revert to the delineating culture of “good enough” or remember the child who wanted to be president for unlimited naps? All that’s left to do is throw doubt to the wind and follow the path that hasn’t been traveled. Do the thing, because that’s all it is at the end of the day. It doesn’t matter if you are good enough or even if you can, because there’s a chance it will fail, but you will definitely fail if you stop. When the hard days come, and the trials of hardship chase you back down that path you’ve been carving, don’t open the door. Turn back and keep moving because you might fall and even fail, but the only metric for true failure is giving up.</p>
        </article>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>So I’ll end this with a quoted question:</p>
            <blockquote>
                “When the darkness of the past and the pride of the future come to see you on this path you are paving, who will you believe?”</blockquote>
            <p>That’s mine, by the way, and I hope you make the brave choice.</p>
